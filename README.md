## Task 6 Customer and Orders  Project

This project is based on a Customer and Orders Management System, implemented using SQL. It includes two related tables:

1.Customers: Stores customer details such as ID, name, and city.

2.Orders: Stores product orders made by customers, including product name and amount.

The relationship between the two tables is defined using a foreign key: each order is linked to a customer using Cust_id.
